# Ruby on Rails 5 for Windows 10
### Just the basics and using Postgreql.

Getting started with Rails on Windows 10 was a pain because Windows tends to have issues with a variety of things. This is the simplest setup I got to consistently work for all of my rails projects on my Windows 10 PC using Bash on Ubunto on Windows for all command line work.

Feel free to use this for your Windows 10 (I haven't tested it on other versions) projects. I hope it helps someone save some time.
